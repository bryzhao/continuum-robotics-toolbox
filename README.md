# Continuum Robotics Toolbox

A Python library for modeling, simulation, and control of continuum robots.

## Overview

This toolbox provides a comprehensive framework for continuum robotics research and education, inspired by Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB. Unlike traditional rigid-link manipulators, continuum robots feature continuous flexible structures that can navigate complex environments and interact safely with delicate objects.

## Motivation

While excellent toolboxes exist for rigid-link robots, open-source simulation tools for continuum robotics remain scarce. This project aims to fill that gap by providing:

- Accessible modeling frameworks for researchers and students
- Extensible architecture supporting multiple kinematic models
- Educational resources for learning continuum robotics concepts
- Foundation for prototyping control algorithms

## Current Status

This project is in early development. Initial implementation focuses on the Constant Curvature (CC) kinematic model.

## Planned Features

- **Kinematic Models**
  - Constant curvature (initial implementation)
  - Piecewise constant curvature
  - Variable curvature models

- **Analysis Tools**
  - Forward kinematics
  - Inverse kinematics
  - Jacobian computation
  - Workspace analysis

- **Visualization**
  - 3D robot configuration plotting
  - Trajectory visualization
  - Interactive manipulation
