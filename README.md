# Continuum Robotics Toolbox

(wip) A Python library for modeling, simulation, and control of continuum robots.

## Overview

This toolbox provides a comprehensive framework for continuum robotics research and education, inspired by Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB. Unlike traditional rigid-link manipulators, continuum robots feature continuous flexible structures that can navigate complex environments and interact safely with objects in their environment.

## Motivation

While excellent toolboxes exist for rigid-link robots, open-source simulation tools for continuum robotics remain scarce. This project aims to fill that gap by (eventually) providing accessible modeling frameworks for researchers and students, extensible architecture supporting multiple kinematic models, educational resources for learning continuum robotics concepts, and a foundation for prototyping control algorithms.

## Current Status

This project is in early development. Initial implementation focuses on the Constant Curvature (CC) kinematic model.

## Planned Features

- **Kinematic Models**
  - Constant curvature (initial implementation)
  - Piecewise constant curvature
  - Variable curvature models

- **Analysis Tools**
  - Forward kinematics
  - Inverse kinematics
  - Jacobian computation
  - Workspace analysis

- **Visualization**
  - 3D robot configuration plotting
  - Trajectory visualization
  - Interactive manipulation
